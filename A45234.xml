            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.3.</note> that I ſhould be judged of ſuch,</hi> or <hi>of Man's judgment;</hi> for I would chooſe rather to come in <hi>Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Speech,</hi> even to the Eyes as well as the Ears of Men, than in <hi>the enticing words of Man's Wiſdom.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> It is often times more difficult to be Profitable than to be Eloquent; in the <hi>latter</hi> our Education qualifies, and makes it eaſie to ſpeak as Men, but in the <hi>former,
<note place="margin">Joh. 3.27.</note> a Man cannot receive it, except it be given him from above.</hi> It is <hi>harder</hi> to ſtoop below a
<pb facs="tcp:44264:8"/>Man's own Proportion, to go the ſame height with <hi>Children,</hi> than to walk our full Length with <hi>Men.</hi> As on the other Hand, it is <hi>eaſier</hi> to Preach or Write ſomewhat like an <hi>Academick,</hi> than like an <hi>Inſtructer of the Fooliſh,
<note place="margin">Rom. 2.20</note> or a Teacher of Babes,</hi> and to play the <hi>Orator</hi> than perform the work of a <hi>Divine.</hi> It is more profitable, and yet a Task of greater <hi>Burden,</hi> to gather up <hi>Matter</hi> from the Holy Text, than to utter it in <hi>fine words.</hi> It is harder to draw the true <hi>Lineaments</hi> of the Face, than to mix the <hi>Paint:</hi> 'Tis more laborious to dig in the Mines, than to gather looſe ſtones upon the Surface, and to <hi>threſh</hi> out the Grain, than <hi>refine</hi> the Heap, and blow away the Chaff.</p>
            <p>What a ſad Caſe were <hi>England</hi> in, if all the Books in Divinity that
<pb facs="tcp:44264:8"/>have been written, had been publiſht (ſuppoſe) in the Profoundeſt Eloquence, as many of the Publiſhers (I doubt not, but) could have done, in reference to their Intellectual Abilities, and ſpoken in a Scholaſtical Phraſe conſiſtently with their Learned Education: But the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar may bleſs God for the Treatiſes that have been written in ſuch a Style as Dr. <hi>Preſton, Sibbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bolton, Rogers, Greenham, Perkins, Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Sedgwick, Allein,</hi> and Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds more.</p>
            <p>The plain Truth is, to publiſh Books for the common ſort in our own Tongue <hi>Nominally,</hi> and ſtuff them all along throughout the Body of the Diſcourſe in other Language <hi>really,</hi> ſavours too much of a <hi>Jeſuitical Equivocation,</hi> while we Condemn the <hi>Papiſt;</hi> for if <hi>they</hi> lock up the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and
<pb facs="tcp:44264:9"/>
               <hi>take away the Key of Knowledge,
<note place="margin">Luk. 11.52</note> thoſe</hi> would lock up other <hi>Good Books,</hi> and give the People a <hi>ſtrange</hi> Key that was never made to open them.</p>
            <p>However, if Men at a <hi>Feaſt</hi> love to ſee fine Glaſſes at a <hi>Side-board,</hi> let them look over to <hi>Margents,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is Pity they ſhould find more than is needful, among the Gueſts, upon the Table.</p>
            <p>Tho' we uſe <hi>Metaphors,</hi> yet it is no more than the ſame Popular, known way, which Chriſt (the beſt Maſter of Language in the World) uſed, when he taught his own Diſciples. We are immers'd ſo much in <hi>Matter,</hi> while in the <hi>Body,</hi> that our Inſtructions had need be <hi>ſenſible</hi> to convey <hi>ſpiritual</hi> Things the eaſier. Theſe are oftentimes more Natural, and do accommodate the
<pb facs="tcp:44264:9"/>Expreſſion to the Thing beyond a Phraſe Sublime, or Philoſophical. As indeed it is too laborious and impertinent to fetch Metaphors remote, or un-obvious, ſo it argues too much Scorn and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to trample thoſe under our Feet which lye next us. As therefore, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, thou findeſt the <hi>whole</hi> likened to a <hi>Supper,
<note place="margin">Eccl. 5.8.</note> Marvel not at the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> if ſometimes thou findeſt the <hi>Parts</hi> of it to be expreſſed in ſuch <hi>Veſſels,</hi> as a Supper, or a Feaſt is wont to be ſerved in withall.</p>
            <p>Let not an occaſional uſe of ſome Expreſſions peculiar to <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> offend any <hi>Engliſh Reader,</hi> becauſe they will not bear a Tranſlation <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batim;</hi> for in this <hi>Feaſt</hi> we did not ſtudy to recommend it by <hi>Forreign Sauces,</hi> and therefore are content to uſe what we find <hi>at home,</hi> and do
<pb facs="tcp:44264:10"/>recommend it to a Chriſtian <hi>Appetite</hi> accordingly. A blunt <hi>Angliciſm</hi> (as we call it) may upon ſome occaſions be more affecting than a borrowed <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiniſm:</hi> A rugged, unpoliſht Phraſe, will ſtick more on ſome minds, and to better purpoſe, than ſmoother Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that ſlides off from their Thoughts very inobſervably; and if we herein do become barbarous to gain the Barbarous, we are but in the ſame Point of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Paul,</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Let it be only Noted by the Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Reader, that the Texts often ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Margent are not brought as <hi>Doctrinal</hi> Proofs, to clear the Truth of what is laid down or opened, but <hi>Alluſive,</hi> or Borrowed Scripture Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which if you look to the

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:44264:21"/>would make it as delicate as he could, to bring it before his Gueſts. 'Tis ſaid <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.6. <hi>He haſtned into the Tent to</hi> Sarah, <hi>and ſaid, Make ready quickly three meaſures of <hi>Fine Meal,</hi> and he ran</hi> (himſelf) <hi>unto the Herd,</hi> V. 7. <hi>and fetcht a Calf,</hi> ('tis not ſaid to be an <hi>ordinary</hi> one, but) <hi>

               <p>Thus, the Goſpel is furniſhed with the <hi>choiceſt Viands,</hi> and God's Servants behold an excellency in the very <hi>Crumbs</hi> which fall from their <hi>Maſters Table.</hi> The King doth not ſlay any <hi>lean Kine,</hi> but in making ready for the Marriage, his Oxen and his <hi>Fatlings</hi> are killed, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.4.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>This preſent Evil World is a Term from which we muſt come,</hi> before we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with God's Invitation.

Let me open this of the World briefly, as to the Things and the Perſons of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In coming off from the World, we muſt come <hi>from the Things</hi> that keep us off from Chriſt; the Profits, Pleaſures, and Applauſe, or vain Eſteem of Men.</p>

<pb n="414" facs="tcp:44264:220"/>Hands of God, and at his Soveraign Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal. It was an Act of <hi>Soveraignty</hi> to prepare the Goſpel, and make it ready in the Time that <hi>now</hi> is. As our <hi>Times are in Goa's Hand,</hi>
